          Apeiropolis, the most technologically advance civilisation known from
          8700 to 8500 B.C. The civilisation managed to harness the power of
          technology and created a city that never rests. Everything was powered
          by technology, cars fly, doctors replace parts of a failing human body
          with mechanical parts, buildings tower over each other, neon signs
          luminated every inch of the city, peoples lives were changed forever.
          <br />
          <br />
          However as technology evolved, people demanded for more. People
          started replacing parts of their body with mechinacal ones, and soon
          war broke out.
          <br />
          <br />
          Civilisations started attacking each other, with Apeiropolis being at
          the heart of that. The Ancients too went to war, they sought out brave
          warriors that would sacrifice their lives for the likes of their
          people. As the most technologically advance civilisation, they
          modified their bodies, some went so far that they can barely be called
          human. The Ancients have created undying monsters that would later be
          known as 'Ghosts'.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, even with all these Apeiropolis still suffered heavy losses,
          and as they ran out of options, 5 lines of defences were set up and
          the bot was the first.
          <br />
          <br />
          The bots name was Constantine Dimitris Papageorgiou the third, also
          known as, Bob. He committed blasphemy towards the Ancients and as a
          result his psychic was trapped in this bot and he had to protect the
          city from intruders for eternity.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the hundereds of years that Bob has defended the city fro
          intruders, there was only ever 1 person that successfully made it
          through. However, what lies after this will only be harder...

          Apeiropolis, just like any other city, started out like a normal city.
          It was only after 8850 B.C where the use of technology started seeing
          an increase. Architechs started experimenting with new building
          designs. As the population of the city increased, architechs were
          forced to built smaller apartment buildings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Some earlier designs of such apartment is as such:

            src="../public/src/blueprint.png"
            alt="blueprint"
            width="783"

          />

              >If you are reading this, you managed to pass through the first 2
              lines of defence. <br />I have decided to leave behind clues for

        <div class="lore act3-lore">
          After the Ancients managed to built up a whole new city, there comes a
          point where everyone wants to live forever.
          <br />
          <br />
          This became a popular area of research by scientists, after decades
          and decades of experimenting, the Ancients had managed to extend their
          life spans by replacing failed body parts or organs with mechanical
          ones. They managed to perfect this technique with a failure rate of
          just 0.05%.
          <br />
          <br />
          This opened up a whole new world or opportunities, scientists then
          further perfected replacing parts of a human body with superior
          mechanical ones to gain abilities that no one previously could have
          dreamt of.
          <br />
          <br />
          With all these, they thought by living longer they would improve their
          efficiency as a race and help achieve happiness. However, little did
          they know, living for longer was boring and a bunch of problems
          happened with mechanical body parts.
          <br />
          <br />
          A leading alchemist then researched on a serum that served as a drug
          to help keep efficiency of people up and help them maintain happiness.
          This serum was sold on the black market and became the go to solution
          for every citizen of Apeiropolis to feel something in life.

          Everything was going fine for the civilisation for hundereds of
          years... until The Great Rupture...
          <br />
          <br />
          Wars broke out and technology was destroyed and lost. Amidst the
          chaos, multiple civilisations targetted Apeiropolis, they attempted to
          wipe out their technology, but Apeiropolis did not back down, they too
          went to war.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sadly, Apeiropolis suffered heavily lost and their city was on the
          brink of distruction, too much was lost already. In a final attempt to
          save their people and city, a leading net runner, Abantes made a break
          through.
          <br />
          <br />
          He figured out how to upload his psyche onto the net, in order to save
          the city he uploaded the whole civilisation onto the net, the undying
          monsters, also known as 'Ghosts', became AI guardians whos sole
          purpose was to protect the city. The ancients sealed off and hid the
          city, they had swore to protect it and that no one shall lay their
          hands on it ever again.
